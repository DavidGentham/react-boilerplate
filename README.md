## Introduction
Boilerplate to kickstart a new React project. 
* Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
* Includes the most important dependencies for any mid-sized project.
* Directory structured to get started right away.

### Redux
Predictable state management.

### React-Redux
Makes React and Redux play nicely together. 'Connected Containers' as a bridge between React Components and Redux Reducers.

### Redux-Saga
Handles side effects. Listens to actions and manages the flow  of (async) utility functions.

### Redux-Persist
Saves the Redux state in local storage to survive page refresh

### React-Router
Manages in app navigation and assigns real urls to sections of single-page-app. Also important for SEO. 

### Styled Components
Declarative approach to styling. `<Text>My Text</Text>` instead of `<p className="className1 className2">My Text</p>`
